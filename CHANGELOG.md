# Changelog

This file lists the changes of each version. The project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Diagnostic codes are in [docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md).

## 0.1.1 - 2026-11-08

The first version for a consumer.

### Added

- `mv <doc-id>#<key or section>... <spec-id>` moves several requirements, or whole sections, into an existing spec or a new one. Each moved requirement keeps its old id as an alias, and links follow it. A preservation check runs before any file changes. If the check fails, `mv` changes nothing and exits with code 1.
- SD807 (warning): a list item starts with a bold slug key and has a BCP 14 keyword, but no colon follows the key.
- `install-source` in `spec-dna.toml`: the git source of spec-dna for the message of a version mismatch and for the CI job of the quickstart.
- `drift-severity` per root: SD606 and SD607 as `off`, `warning` (default) or `error`.
- `init` prints the `git add` command for the files that it wrote.

### Changed

- SD405 ignores link destinations. A move that rewrites a link in an accepted decision does not change its frozen text. The index format changed (parser version 7), so the first run parses all documents again.
- The message of a version mismatch says "move the project to", for both directions.
- The skill tells agents to split a document with one `mv`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-08

A local tag for the first demo. It was not published.

- `context <code path>` serves the sections that cite the file: by path, `path:line`, link, directory or identifier.
- SD606 and SD607 (warnings): a change removes or renames a path or an identifier that a document cites.
- `init` writes one line into each root instruction file, never an import, and prints the bytes that it adds to the prompt prefix. It does not run when the pin differs from the binary.
- `transcript` counts the spec-dna commands of an agent.
