# Changelog

This file lists the changes of each version. The project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). Diagnostic codes are in [docs/diagnostics.md](docs/diagnostics.md).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-11-08

Profiles, 4 knowledge types, requirement evidence and an interactive `init`. The goal: a growing corpus stays orderly, so agents stay fast and cheap.

### Added

- `profile = "lite" | "standard" | "strict"` sets the default severity of each code. `[rules]` and the `rules` of a root override it by rule group (`references`, `ids`, `budgets`, `drift`, `evidence`, `lint`) or by code. A root can have its own `profile`. [docs/profiles.md](docs/profiles.md) gives the table.
- 4 document types: `invariant` (project-wide rules with stable ids and an `applies-to` scope; `context` serves a matching invariant first), `runbook`, `incident` (it must link the requirements, decisions or runbooks that it involves: SD609) and `reference` (cold material: no budget, and `context` never serves it unless a target names it). Each type has a template, required sections and budgets. [docs/types.md](docs/types.md).
- `spec-dna new <type> <id>` writes a document from the template of its type. In a mixed root, each type gets its own namespace. SD306 (error): a template placeholder (`{{text}}`) is still in a document.
- `types` in `spec-dna.toml`: the document types of the project. A document of another type is an error (SD303).
- `required-sections` accepts a list of lists: several required sections for a type.
- Evidence: a requirement links to tests by `verified-by` (front matter, or an inline `<!-- verified-by: <path> -->` marker) or by a `covers: <doc-id>#<key>` tag in a test file of any language (`[evidence] tests`). SD105 (error): a tag names no requirement. SD608 (by profile): an active requirement has no evidence. `show` lists the evidence of each requirement.
- `init` detects the repository and asks at most 8 questions with the detected defaults: the profile, the knowledge types, the evidence policy and link style, the language and heading aliases, the mapping of each detected root, the budget level, the agent adapters, and the CI step, hook and base branch. It shows the full `spec-dna.toml` and the files to create or change, and writes them only after a confirmation. Modes: `--non-interactive`, `--answers <file>`, `--reconfigure`, `--dry-run`. It can write a GitHub Actions job and a pre-commit or husky hook. [docs/init.md](docs/init.md).

### Changed

- A configuration without `profile` uses `standard`. In it, the requirement lint is off (0.1: warnings) and SD608 is a warning. `[rules] lint = "warning"` and `[rules] evidence = "off"` keep the behavior of 0.1.
- `lint-severity` and `drift-severity` of a root are now the rules `lint` and `drift` of that root.
- The line in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` and the skill ask for one `context` call for a task that edits code or docs, and none for a question. The skill names `new` and `covers:`, and its body has 1,863 characters (0.1.2: 2,392).
- The text output of `check` gives the fix of each listed code once.
- The default `context` budget is 8,000 characters (was 12,000).
- The parser reads the inline `verified-by` marker. The index format changed (parser version 9), so the first run parses all documents again.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-11-08

Fixes of the defects that a playground product of 12 agent tasks found in 0.1.1.

### Fixed

- `mv` of requirements: a list item can end after a blank line. A cut or an insert at that end joined the next paragraph to a moved or a remaining item, so the preservation check refused a valid move. The move now cuts and inserts whole lines without the blank lines after the item.
- `mv` of requirements: the preservation check compares the requirement text without link destinations, because the move rewrites the links to a moved key or section. The index format changed (parser version 8), so the first run parses all documents again.
- A refused move names each requirement whose text would change, and gives the text before and after the first difference, or says that the requirement would be lost or new.
- `mv` of requirements records an alias only for an id of `HEAD`. A key that is new in the uncommitted change gets no alias.
- SD606 and SD607 on the frozen text of an accepted decision: an amendment section that cites the new path or identifier clears them for that decision. Before, no valid change could clear them, except a supersede.

### Changed

- The text output of `check` lists the errors first, then the drift warnings (SD606, SD607), then the other warnings. It gives one line with a count for each prose lint code (SD801 to SD805). `--lint` lists each of these warnings. The JSON output did not change.
- The skill tells agents when to amend an accepted decision (the outcome stays) and when to supersede it (the outcome changes), and to name new code paths of an accepted decision in its amendment section.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-11-08

The first version for a consumer.

### Added

- `mv <doc-id>#<key or section>... <spec-id>` moves several requirements, or whole sections, into an existing spec or a new one. Each moved requirement keeps its old id as an alias, and links follow it. A preservation check runs before any file changes. If the check fails, `mv` changes nothing and exits with code 1.
- SD807 (warning): a list item starts with a bold slug key and has a BCP 14 keyword, but no colon follows the key.
- `install-source` in `spec-dna.toml`: the git source of spec-dna for the message of a version mismatch and for the CI job of the quickstart.
- `drift-severity` per root: SD606 and SD607 as `off`, `warning` (default) or `error`.
- `init` prints the `git add` command for the files that it wrote.

### Changed

- SD405 ignores link destinations. A move that rewrites a link in an accepted decision does not change its frozen text. The index format changed (parser version 7), so the first run parses all documents again.
- The message of a version mismatch says "move the project to", for both directions.
- The skill tells agents to split a document with one `mv`.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-11-08

A local tag for the first demo. It was not published.

- `context <code path>` serves the sections that cite the file: by path, `path:line`, link, directory or identifier.
- SD606 and SD607 (warnings): a change removes or renames a path or an identifier that a document cites.
- `init` writes one line into each root instruction file, never an import, and prints the bytes that it adds to the prompt prefix. It does not run when the pin differs from the binary.
- `transcript` counts the spec-dna commands of an agent.
